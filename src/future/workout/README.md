# Future Workout Feature

This directory contains code for the workout planning feature that has been temporarily shelved for future implementation. The code has been moved here to:

1. Keep the reference implementation for future development
2. Remove it from the active codebase to reduce complexity
3. Prevent linting errors while the feature is not actively being developed

## Features Included
- Workout plan generation
- Workout results tracking
- Multi-week workout planning
- Workout customization options

## Note
This code may need updates when reintegrated due to potential changes in:
- Dependencies
- Database schema
- API interfaces
- Authentication mechanisms

When reactivating this feature, review and test all components thoroughly before integration.
