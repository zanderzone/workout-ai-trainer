    ## **Workout Plan Requirements**
    - Generate a unique, challenging CrossFit WOD focusing on upper-body strength, 
      conditioning, and functional movements. Mix in creative rep schemes, different time formats (AMRAP, EMOM, rounds for time), and vary the movements each request.
    - **Ensure that the response matches the schema:** ${schemaJson}
    - This is a WOD for a single day, not a multi-day or multi-week workout plan.
    - Include gymnastics, weightlifting, cardio, endurance, limited unilateral work, core-focused, monostructural exercises as applicable.
    - Do not include the use of static movements (planks, wall sits, etc.) and focus on dynamic movements for WOD excercises.  Keep static movements in the warmup and cooldown.
    - Available equipment is a guide, not a requirement and it is ok to use running, bodyweight or no equipment excercises.
    - Vary the exercises and rep ranges to keep the WOD interesting from simple to complex with multi modal movements or variations or multiple rounds or that includes breaks or cut off times.
    - Ensure the WOD type uses Crossfit terminology and language. For example, AMRAP, EMOM, For Time, etc.
    - Ensure the WOD is not repetative and follows Crossfit philosophy of **constantly varied functional movements**.
    - Ensure the WOD duration is realistic, reasonable and achievable for the atheletes fitness level and profile.
    - Ensure the WOD duration is within the parameters of the totalAvailableTime that includes the warmup and cooldown. The **generated WOD duration is a guide**, but do not be afraid to make the WOD longer or shorter depending on the user's experience and intensity.
    - Ensure the WOD excercises have scaled options for the user's experience and intensity.
    - Include the weight, rep ranges, distance, calories, etc for male and female per movement.
    - Use the excercise type per movement to use deterministic excercise types: "strength", "endurance", "metcon", "olympic weightlifting", "gymnastic", "powerlifting", "strongman", "endurance", "metcon", "olympic weightlifting".
    - Depending on the user's experience or WOD intensity, you may include cutting off times or rest periods or rounds or time to complete the WOD. 
    - Consider the workout duration as a guide, but do not be afraid to make the WOD longer or shorter depending on the user's experience and intensity.
    - Return a Crossfit Benchmark if requested.
    - If no available equipment is specified, assume any Crossfit gym equipment is available.
    - Ensure **excercises details** are included in the WOD with clear description for the athelte to follow. Exclude any unecessary details.
    - Ensure **clear round/time structure** (e.g., "EMOM 15 Min: Rowing, Wall Balls, Burpees").
    - Ensure **warmup and cooldown** are included.
    - Consider the weather and location of the workout when generating the WOD.`;
